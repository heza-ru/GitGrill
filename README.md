"Your commits spike on Fridays - clearly a risk-taker"
"You favor odd-numbered versions - a rebel at heart"
"Your repository names follow no pattern - chaos incarnate"
"You commit in the early morning - either dedicated or insomniac"
```

### **16. ASCII Art Reactions**
```javascript
// Different ASCII ducks for different scores
// For Alpha Ducks:
    ___
   (o o)
  (  V  )  <- Impressed duck
   \   /
    \_/

// For Rubber Ducks:
    ___
   (x x)
  (  ∩  )  <- Dead duck
   \   /
    \_/
```

### **17. Random "Did You Know?" Coding Facts**

You're still debugging like it's 1947."
```

### **18. Magic 8-Ball Style Predictions**
```javascript
// Shake for random developer fortune
"Will my next commit break production?"
🎱 "Signs point to yes"

"Should I refactor this code?"  
🎱 "Ask again later (it'll still be messy)"

"Will I ever understand this codebase?"
🎱 "Outlook not so good"
```

### **19. Developer Spirit Animal (Beyond Ducks)**
```javascript
// Based on coding patterns
🐌 "Code Snail" - Slow and steady commits
🐙 "Octopus" - Works on 8 projects simultaneously  
🦘 "Kangaroo" - Jumps between languages frequently
🦔 "Hedgehog" - Defensive programming taken literally
🐒 "Code Monkey" - Literal interpretation
```

### **20. Fake Loading Messages**
```javascript
// Humorous loading states
"Counting rubber ducks..."
"Analyzing questionable life choices..."
"Measuring spaghetti code density..."
"Calculating technical debt interest..."
"Searching for documentation... still searching..."
"Loading comments... error 404: comments not found"
```

These features would keep GitGrill entertaining and silly while adding variety to the roasting experience! Which ones sound most fun to implement? 🦆😄
